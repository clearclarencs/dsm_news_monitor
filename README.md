# DSM News Monitor

My first ever JS program :)

Monitors dsm's whats new page to check for raffles or upcoming releases

Simply input the regional site you want monitoring in the monitor_url variable, add your discord webhooks in webhooks.json and run!

Sites avalable include:
- https://london.doverstreetmarket.com/new-items
- https://newyork.doverstreetmarket.com/new-items
- https://ginza.doverstreetmarket.com/new-items
- https://singapore.doverstreetmarket.com/new-items

webhooks.json is seperated into news types to allow filtering for specific types or just use the all array.

**As this is my first js project this program is far from smooth or efficient and can definately be improved on.**
